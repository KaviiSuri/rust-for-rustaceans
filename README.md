# Rust for Rustaceans

This repo is my notes / follow along for the book [Rust for Rustaceans](#TODO Add link). 

## Goals
The Primary goal is to learn to use Rust **for Real**.
- Develop a pragmatic approach to writing rust
- Understand the borrow checker and lifetime system better
- Developer skills to write and read idiomatic rust
- Understand Async Rust and it's pros/cons
- Design and Develop projects using Rust (ideally idiomatic)
- Learn systems programming

## How is this repo structured?

This repo is structured as a [Cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html), with multiple crates.

I plan to make one crate or folder(as required) for each chapter, although it might change in the future.

### Chapters
- [Chapter 1 - Foundations](./chapter_1)
- [Chapter 2 - Types](./chapter_2)
- [Chapter 3 - Designing Interfaces](./chapter_3)
